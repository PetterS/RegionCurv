This package generates four main programs:

- one for unsupervised image segmentation
- one for supervised image segmentation with seed nodes
- one for inpainting 
- one for image denoising

In all cases a discretized curvature model is employed and optimized.  There
are a number of optimization techniques available that all strongly relate to
linear programming. The default is to use standard LP solvers, but there are
also message passing methods and QPBO.

This introduction gives the main points one needs to know to work with the
software. It currently only addresses segmentation.


*** UNSUPERVISED IMAGE SEGMENTATION ***

This performs segmentation with squared intensity differences in the data term.

Assuming you want to segment an image sample.pgm (in PGM format) with
curvature regularity and into two different regions (foreground+background), a
typical call would look like this:

bin/lpseg.debug.L64 -i sample.pgm -lambda 10 -gamma 10000 -o sample_out

This sets a length weight of 10, a curvature weight of 10000, and uses an
8-connectivity. Using a 16-connectivity gives better results, but needs more
time and memory. To select this, add

-n 16

to the command line.

The call will write several output images:

-sample_out.out.ppm contains the computed boundary line superimposed on the input image
-sample_out.seg.pgm contains the computed segmentation in five-fold resolution
-sample_out.frac.pgm contains a visualization of the integrality of the region variables,
    encoded in shades of gray (white and black denote integral values)

****** Setting the number of regions ******

To select the number of regions, add

-regions <num>

to the command line


****** Selecting the constraint system *****

When running in standard mode (derived from [Schoenemann, Kahl, Cremers ICCV
2009]), you can select several constraint systems:

-boundary-constraints tight  
    this activates the constraints of [Strandmark & Kahl EMMCVPR 2011]. 
    This is the default and recommended.
-boundary-constraints simple
    this activates a simpler set of constraints that results in a weaker segmentation.
-boundary-constraints extra
    this activates both sets of constrains
-boundary-constraints off
    in this mode there are only the constraints from ICCV 2009, which do not correctly
    force the boundary variables to be the boundary of the region variables.

If you add

-light-constraints

to the command lines, a memory-saving version of the above constraints is
used. In practice it gives equal results, but this is not theoretically proven.

Furthermore, you can add

-ignore-crossings

to the command line, to select a less intuitive treatment of points where
three or more regions meet.

**** Selecting alternative formulations ****

There are two kinds of formulations supported by RegionCurv at the moment. By default,
the kind started by [Schoenemann, Kahl, Cremers ICCV 2009] is selected. You can activate 
it explicitly by adding

-method lp 

to the command line. Here there are several computational methods available: 

-mode standard : will use an lp-solver.
-mode icm      : use iterated conditional modes (evolution of integral solutions)
-mode bp | msd | mplp | trws | chain-dd : 
               various message passing routines, developed in collaboration
               with Vladimir Kolmogorov (see [Kolmogorov & Schoenemann Arxiv 2012]).
               If -ignore-crossings is set this is currently ignored
                      


Alternatively, there are factor-based methods. Select them by adding

-method factor-lp

to the command line. There are some more modes here:

-mode standard : will use an lp-solver.
-mode icm      : use iterated conditional modes (evolution of integral solutions)
-mode qpbo     : method of [El Zehiry & Grady CVPR 10] and [Strandmark & Kahl EMMCVPR 2011].
                 This is based on max-flow with probing. (You need the QPBO-solver of 
		 Vladimir Kolmogorov).
-mode msd      : use min-sum diffusion as in [Schoenemann, Kuang, Kahl EMMCVPR 2011]
-mode bp | mplp | trws | chain-dd :
                various message passing routines with singleton separators, developed in collaboration
                with Vladimir Kolmogorov (see [Kolmogorov & Schoenemann Arxiv 2012]) 
-mode sep-msd | sep-trws | sep-chain-dd
                various message passing routines with pairwise separators, developed in collaboration
                with Vladimir Kolmogorov (see [Kolmogorov & Schoenemann Arxiv 2012]) 



***** Selecting the mesh ******

By default, each pixel is split into several basic regions. You can specify a coarser grid by adding
any of the options

-griddim <uint>
-griddimx <uint>
-griddimy <uint>

You can also enable hexagonal meshes, which may result in less directional bias. To do this, add

-hex-mesh 

to the command line. To activate adaptive meshing [Strandmark & Kahl EMMCVPR 2011], add

-adaptive <uint>

**** Setting mean values ****

Mean values for foreground and background can be set via

-mu0 <double>
-mu1 <double>

**** Selecting the standard LP-solver ***/

By default the solver CLP is used. You can also use Gurobi, CPLEX and Xpress, by
adding

-solver <solvername>

Selecting -solver own-conv activates the augmented lagrangian implementation
as in [Schoenemann, Kuang, Kahl EMMCVPR 2011].

*** SUPERVISED IMAGE SEGMENTATION ***

For supervised image segmentation, in addition to the input image you need to
specify two more images that encode masks for foreground and background. These
need to be in PGM format, and black values denote regions whose label is to be
fixed to the respective region, white values denote regions that are to be
segmented.  

Here histograms are computed to derive the data terms.

A sample call looks like this:

bin/interactiveseg.debug.L64 -i sample.pgm -fg-mask fg_mask.pgm -bg-mask bg_mask.pgm -lambda 0.2 -gamma 4.0 -o sample_out

Many of the options listed for unsupervised segmentation above apply here as
well, in particular regarding the neighborhood and the constraint formulation.
Others, like selecting the number of regions, are currently not
implemented. Note that there are no mean values to set here.
