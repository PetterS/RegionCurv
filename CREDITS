This code was written by Thomas Schoenemann, Petter Strandmark and Yubin Kuang
in 2009-2013. Thomas Schoenemann worked on this in his free time, at Lund
University, Sweden, at the University of Pisa, Italy and at the University of
DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Petter Strandmark and Yubin Kuang worked on this at Lund
Univeristy, Sweden.

Some parts of the code (relating to message passing) were developed in close
collaboration with Vladimir Kolmogorov.

The first version was written by Thomas Schoenemann in 2009, based on
open publications. Later, the code was completed and augmented at Lund
University, Sweden. This was done jointly by Thomas Schoenemann and
Petter Strandmark, with additional assistance by Yubin Kuang and
Fredrik Kahl.

Furthermore, the project includes parts of the C++-Toolbox in version
1.03, written by Thomas Schoenemann.
