CHANGE history for RegionCurv


**** upcoming release (1.0?)

- released curvature denoising
- can optionally use a convex prior now
- strengthend the relaxation to ensure that boundaries do not cross
- multi-region class (constraint-based) can now enforce that boundaries do not cross
- factor-based routines are now available for multi-region problems
- integrated stand-alone routines to compute the energy of an integral solution
  (i.e. no longer solving a large-scale linear program there)
- added curve evolution as a postprocessing stage
- integrated ICM postprocessing stage
- new implementation of min-sum diffusion, much faster in practice
- added option to ignore some of the possible line pairs (does not give much speed-up)

**** version 0.905 ****

- added some things that were accidentally forgotten in version 0.9
- corrected the implementation of min-sum diffusion
- for the clique-based problem there is now a stand-alone routine
  to compute the energy of a discrete labeling.
- added an introduction

**** version 0.9 ****
- added contents of the papers [Strandmark & Kahl EMMCVPR 2011]
and [Schoenemann, Kuang, Kahl EMMCVPR 2011]
- included these papers in the license conditions


**** version 0.8 ****
first released version
